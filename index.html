💘 Prompt: Valentine Heart Website with Loop Buttons

Create a single-page responsive website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with the following requirements:

🎨 Design Requirements:

The main container should be a heart shape design in the center of the screen.

Background should be romantic (soft pink/red gradient).

Inside the heart, display a large text:
"Will you be my Valentine?"

Use smooth animations and cute hover effects.

Make it mobile-friendly and centered both vertically and horizontally.

🔘 Buttons Layout:

Below the text inside the heart:

Show two buttons:

Yes ❤️

No 💔

❌ No Button Behavior (Loop Logic):

When the user clicks No:

Hide the No button.

Show a new button with text:

"Are you sure?"

When the user clicks Are you sure?:

Hide it.

Show next button:

"This is not possible 😢"

When clicked:

Hide it.

Show next button:

"Think again 🤔"

When clicked:

Hide it.

Bring back the original No 💔 button.

👉 This loop should repeat infinitely every time No is clicked.

✅ Yes Button Behavior:

When user clicks Yes ❤️:

Show a popup modal or alert message:

"Congratulations ❤️ I knew you would say YES!"

Add small heart animation or confetti effect when popup appears.

⚙️ Technical Requirements:

Use pure HTML, CSS, JavaScript (no frameworks).

Keep code clean and commented.

Use CSS for heart shape creation (no images).

Add smooth transitions and button animations.

All code should be in one HTML file (internal CSS + JS).

✨ Extra Effects (Optional but Preferred):

Floating hearts animation in background.

Button bounce animation on hover.

Soft glowing heart border.
